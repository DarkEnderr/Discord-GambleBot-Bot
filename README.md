# Discord Gamble Bot

This is one of my several in-progress Discord bots that have several gambling games built in. Music, smarter moderation, and more are soon to come. Website is also being created to show bot data.

## Getting Started

If you would like to deploy this bot to use it in your own servers, I will walk you through how to set this up.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Node.js (V 10.14.1+)
* NPM (V 6.4.1+)
* Discord-GambleBot-API
* Discord-GambleBot-EventPublisher

### Installing

First, change to the directory of the bot.

```
cd /Discord-GambleBot-Bot
```

Now, run npm install to get all dependencies
```
npm i
```

You now should have a working version of the bot. You need to fill in your bot configuration with the needed settings now.

Once you have done that, you can run:

```
node main.js
```

The bot should be started and you should see it running in discord.

Type into Discord

```
!help
```

If the bot is responding, everything is working.
